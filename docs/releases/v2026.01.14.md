Notes / highlights

• Core numerical fix: `src/ccw/coupled_ode.py` refactor — robust evaluation of H(a) and scalar field dynamics in ln(a) time with explicit safeguards to avoid non-physical and non-finite intermediate values. This resolves test failures and improves stability.
• Reproducibility: regenerated `papers/lqg_cc_constraints/data/scan_results.tsv` using the LQG predictor adapter and recompiled `papers/lqg_cc_constraints/lqg_cc_constraints.pdf` so the short paper matches the current codebase.
• New features and demos: toy spin-foam vacuum mechanism, demo scripts, and tests added; expanded TASKS plan and phase completion updates.
• Tests: `pytest` is green (all tests passing in CI on this branch at the release commit).
